# What you need in python : 
Library : Tensorflow + Numpy + OpenCV + glob 

Algorithms : Softmax + Deep Neural Net + Drop out + Adam optimizer + Mini batch + Relu

Since image recognition using pythonn and openCV, which allows you to identify which hand actions that you intend to. There are three classifications, zero & one & two, and each value is assigned to its own. The principle explained in detail by following pictures and descriptions :

# how to use : 
Type the following actions you want to try when you execute the main file, which is 'Custom_MCC_NN_Softmax.py'
-'c' for default webcam with openCV recognition
-'i' for specific file for classification on absolute file location
-'k' for K-means for classification (incompleted)
