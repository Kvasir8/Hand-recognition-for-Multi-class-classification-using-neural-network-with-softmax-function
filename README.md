Algorithms : Softmax + Deep Neural Net + Drop out + Adam optimizer + Mini batch + Relu

This program is designed to classfiy hand shapes with utilizing image recognition using python and openCV, and allows you to identify which hand action that you intend to. There are three classifications: zero & one & two, and each value is assigned to its own label. The principle explained in detail by following pictures and descriptions :

# How to use : 
Type the following actions you want to try when you execute the main file, which is 'Custom_MCC_NN_Softmax.py'

-'c' for openCV recognition with default webcam on your PC

-'i' for specific file for classification on absolute file location

-'k' for K-means for classification (incompleted)
