# Hand recognition for Multi-class classification using neural network with softmax function
special thanks to prof. Won in Chungnam National University

Since image recognition using pythonn and openCV, which allows you to identify which hand actions that you intend to. There are three classifications, zero & one & two, and each value is assigned to its own.

# What you need in python : 
Library : Tensorflow + Numpy + OpenCV + glob 

Algorithms : Softmax + Deep Neural Net + Drop out + Adam optimizer + Mini batch + Relu
